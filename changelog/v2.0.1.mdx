### User interface overhaul

Upon receiving valuable feedbacks, it was clear that the previous implementation of the UI design for the dashboard was lacking on some important necessities. In the dark mode, the blue-ish gradient effect made readability a bit of a challenge whereas inconsistencies in the design of elements were quite apparent to look at.

This update brings a massive overhaul to the user interface of the dashboard. Unnecessary flairs from the design which were previously distracting to the eyes are removed in favour of a more minimalistic approach. The overall contrast and colour profile in both the light and dark mode has been changed making the dashboard much more delightful to use.

<br/>

### Command palette actions

Previously the command palette (accessible using <kbd>⌘K</kbd> shortcut) worked merely as a search tool to quickly search for links and collections. With the new update, it is a much more integral part of your daily activities on Stacks. You can quickly perform various actions ranging from creating links, collections, managing them, switching between workspaces or even change your preferred theme to light to dark. Just press <kbd>⌘K</kbd> to get started.

<br/>

### Right sidebar updates

Just like the command palette, the right sidebar too is now much more meaningful in your daily activities. For starters, we now have right sidebars for almost every pages. [Collections](https://app.betterstacks.com/collections), [My Account](https://app.betterstacks.com/account), Smart collections and [Import](https://app.betterstacks.com/import) are some of the pages where we did not have a right sidebars previously which we do now.

In the sidebar in the [Dashboard](https://app.betterstacks.com/) page you can access all your quick links in a nice list view with options to delete or edit those quick links individually to be added soon. In the sidebar in a individual collection page, you can see all the people who have access to the links in that collections in the Collaborators section of the sidebar. This feature is perfect for quickly looking up to whom your links will be shared if you decide to add them in that collection.

Additional information and actions can also be found in the sidebar for [Collections](https://app.betterstacks.com/collections), [Import](https://app.betterstacks.com/import) and [My Account](https://app.betterstacks.com/account) pages with more options and information to be added later.

<br/>

### Collapse the main sidebar

Yes, the main sidebar is now collapsible as well. Look for the toggle button next to the breadcrumb in the top navigation bar or simply press <kbd>[</kbd> to toggle. You can navigate between pages and all your different collections in the collapsed state as well. Just that you have to identify the pages by their associated emoji. Although the tooltips are there to be of assistance. Just hover your mouse over an icon and more information will pop up.

<br/>

### Right click on things

Context menus are now live. You can right click on any collection or links wherever you see them to open up a menu with more options to manage them. Edit things, delete them, move them, everything is just a right click away. Try right clicking the link cards on the [Dashboard](https://app.betterstacks.com/).

<br/>

### Features

- Quick links are now accessible through the right sidebar in the [Dashboard](https://app.betterstacks.com/)
- You can now see which page you are on in the left sidebar
- Context menus are added. To manage a link or collection wherever you see them, just right click on them.
- There are now right sidebars on the [Collections](https://app.betterstacks.com/collections), Smart Collections, [My Account](https://app.betterstacks.com/account) and [Import](https://app.betterstacks.com/import)pages for additional context and information
- In a collection page, the right sidebar now shows all those who have access to that collection in the Collaborators section – perfect for quickly seeing with whom your links will be shared
- Command palette <kbd>⌘K</kbd> has now options to perform every action including managing links, collections, workspaces to update preferences
- You can collapse or expand the main sidebar as well. Look for the toggle button left to the breadcrumb or simple press <kbd>[</kbd> to toggle
- You can add new sub-collection easily when on an individual collection page. Look for the <kbd>New sub-collection</kbd> button next to filter and sort options

### Changes

- Page title is no longer shown next to the Filter button, instead the breadcrumb is moved there replacing the title. The former position of breadcrumb is now occupied by a more prominent and easily accessible search functionality
