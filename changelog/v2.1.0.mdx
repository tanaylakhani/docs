### API keys

API keys are a way to access your Stacks account programmatically. You can use them to build integrations,
automate tasks, or even create your own custom workflows. You can create multiple API keys and manage them from the
settings page. Each API key can be given a name to help you identify them later and a set of permissions defining the
resources that can be access through the use of that particular key. You can also revoke an API key at any time.

To create or manage your API keys, click on your profile picture in the top right-hand corner of the dashboard and
select `API Keys`. From there, you can create a new API key, view the existing ones, or revoke them.

### Pages

Pages are collaborative documents that you can create and share with your team. You can use them to write notes, draft
documents, or even create a wiki. You can invite your team members to collaborate on a page, and everyone can see the
changes in real-time. You can also leave notes on a page to discuss specific sections or ask questions.

Pages were there in the previous (soon to be deprecated) dashboard. We have brought them back with a fresh new look
and a few improvements. You can create a new page by clicking on the `+` button in the left sidebar next to the `Pages`
link. Or simply press `P` on your keyboard to create a new page.
