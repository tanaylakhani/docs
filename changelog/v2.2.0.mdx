### Onboarding

Onboarding is a process that helps new users get started with the application. It guides them through the process of
creating their first workspace and setting them up for success.

When a new user signs up, they will be greeted with a welcome message and a brief overview of the application. They will
then be guided through the process of creating their first workspace. This includes selecting a name for the workspace,
their own name, and a profile picture. After then they will be asked about where they heard about the Stacks and
after a brief founder's message, they will be taken to their new workspace.

Existing users can access the onboarding process by navigating to [Onboarding](https://app.betterstacks.com/onboarding).
But because they are already familiar with the application, they can skip the process and go directly to their
workspace. It won't even be very beneficial for them even if they decide to go through with it.

### Full changelog
