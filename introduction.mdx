## What is Stacks?

Stacks is the centralized workspace where you and your team can seamlessly capture, organize, and collaboratively build
upon all the valuable information and insights you encounter online. Stacks can be anything as simple as just a bookmark
manager or as complicated as your second brain for the internet.

Stacks lets you capture and organize information on the web at the speed of thought. Once you save it, you or anyone
from your team won't have to manually find it when you need it. Relevant save information will automatically resurface
for you when you need it.

## How does it work?

The main component of Stacks' experience is the browser extension. You will capture links, articles, videos, images, and
more on the web using the extension during your browsing sessions. The extension will save the information to your
personal or your team workspace in Stacks. Then later when you or someone from your team need something and you search
for it on Google or any other relevant search engine, Stacks will automatically show you the relevant information you
saved in your workspace. It happens automatically, just like magic!
