Stacks offers an intelligent tagging system that uses AI to suggest smart tags for your newly added links, making it easier to organize and find your saved content. Additionally, the Dashboard Tag Filter helps you quickly locate specific items using these tags.

### Smart Tagging (AI)

Stacks automatically suggests relevant tags for your links using AI, helping you categorize your content effortlessly. Here’s how it works:

1. **Automatic Smart Tags**:
    - When you add a new link, Stacks analyzes its content and suggests relevant **smart tags**.
    - These AI-generated tags help classify your link based on its content, making it easier to organize.
2. **Manual Tag Editing**:
    - You can also manually add or edit tags for any link.
    - Simply click on the **Tags** section while saving a link or editing an existing one, and enter the tags you want.
    - This allows you to further customize how your content is organized based on your preferences.

### Using Tag Filters on the Dashboard

The Dashboard Tag Filter feature allows you to quickly search and filter links using tags. Here’s how to use it:

1. **Access the Tag Filter**:
    - On the Stacks Dashboard, locate the **Tag Filter** option, typically found at the top of your links list.
2. **Filter by Tags**:
    - Click on the **Tag Filter** to view a list of available tags.
    - Select one or multiple tags to filter the links shown on your dashboard.
    - This helps you find specific items quickly based on their assigned tags.
3. **Refining Your Search**:
    - You can use multiple tags to narrow down your search results further, giving you quick access to the most relevant links.
