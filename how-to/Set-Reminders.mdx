Stacks makes it easy to set reminders for your saved links, helping you revisit important content at the right time. You can set reminders directly from both the browser extension and the Stacks Dashboard. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Setting a Reminder via Extension

You can quickly set a reminder while bookmarking a new link using the Stacks browser extension:

1. **Bookmark the Link to Stacks**:
    - While on the webpage you want to save, click on the **Stacks icon** in your browser toolbar to open the extension.
2. **Save a New Link with Reminder**:
    - Enter any details required like **notes or tags**.
    - Look for the **Reminder** option and set the date and time when you want to be notified.
3. **Confirmation Message**:
    - After saving, a confirmation message will appear indicating that the reminder has been successfully set.

### Setting a Reminder via Dashboard

You can also set reminders for existing links or notes directly from the Stacks Dashboard:

1. **Open the Stacks Dashboard**:
    - Sign in to your Stacks account and navigate to your saved links.
2. **Set a Reminder**:
    - Choose an existing link or note that you want to set a reminder for.
    - Click on the **Set Reminder** icon or option next to the item.
    - Select the desired date and time for your reminder.
3. **Save the Reminder**:
    - Click **Save** to confirm the reminder setting. Your chosen link will now have a reminder attached.

### Reminder Email Notification

Stacks sends an email notification when your reminder is due, helping you stay on top of your tasks:
