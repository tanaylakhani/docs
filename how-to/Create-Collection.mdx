There are multiple ways to create a collection in Stacks. The easiest way is to look for the **+ button** in the sidebar next to the **Collections** header. Click on it, and you will be presented with a dialog where you can enter the **title** and **description** of your collection. You can also add an **emoji** to your collection to make it more visually appealing.

Optionally, you can mark the collection as **public**. That way, anyone with the link can view it. This option is turned off by default.

### Creating a Collection from the Collections Page

You can also create a collection from the **Collections** page:

1. Click on the **Collections** link in the sidebar to open the collections page.
2. Here, you will see a list of all collections in the workspace.
3. Click on the **New collection** button next to the **Sort** and **Filter** buttons.
4. You will be presented with the same dialog as before, where you can enter the **title** and **description** of your collection.

### Creating a Collection from the Extension

If you are using the Stacks browser extension, follow these steps to create a new collection:

1. Click on the Stacks icon in your browser toolbar to save the current link.
2. A pop-up window will open.
3. Go to the **"Type to search or add new collection"** field.
4. **Fill in the Details**:
    - Search or enter a **title** for your collection.
    - Optionally, provide a **note** to give more context.
5. **Save the Link**: The saved link will now appear in your collections.
