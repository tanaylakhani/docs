## Overview

Collections are essentially just folders. They are containers for saves within a workspace. You can create collections
to group saves by topic, project, or any other criteria you like. There is no one way to organize your collections, so
you can create them in a way that makes sense to you.

Collections can be nested within each other to create a hierarchy of saves. A save can belong to multiple collections
at the same time. This means that you can organize your saves in multiple ways without duplicating them. Similarly, a
collection can be part of multiple workspaces. This allows you to share collections with other users or teams.

#### Collection icon

A collection has a title and a description. The title is mandatory while the description is optional. You can also add
an emoji to your collection to make it more visually appealing. If you choose not to, it will have a default folder icon
instead.

#### Public collections

Collections are private by default, which means that only you or whoever has access to the workspace the collection
belongs to can see them. However, you can make a collection public so that anyone with the link can view it. This is
useful when you want to share a collection with someone who is not part of your workspace.

## Creating a collection

There are multiple ways to create a collection in Stacks. The easiest way is to look for the `+` button in the sidebar
next to the `Collections` header. Click on it and you will be presented with a dialog where you can enter the title and
description of your collection. You can also add an emoji to your collection to make it more visually appealing.
Optionally, you can mark the collection as public. That way anyone with the link can view it. This option is turned off
by default.

You can also create a collection from the `Collections` page. Click on the `Collections` link in the sidebar to open the
collections page. Here you will see a list of all collections in the workspace. Click on the `New collection` button
next to the `Sort` and `Filter` buttons. You will be presented with the same dialog as before where you can enter the
title and description of your collection.

Or to quickly create a collection from anywhere in the app, press `Shift` `C`.

## Sub-collections

You can create sub-collections within a collection to further organize your saves. To create a sub-collection, open the
parent collection and click on the `New sub-collection` button next to the `Sort` and `Filter` buttons. You will be
presented with a dialog where you can enter the title and description of your sub-collection.

That `New sub-collection` button is also available on the right sidebar when you are viewing a collection or by right
clicking on a collection.

Note that collection can always be moved to another collection or workspace. To move a collection, right click on the
collection or click on the three dots menu next to a collection name and select `Move collection`.
