## Overview

A Stacks workspace is like a container for all saves, collections and notes belonging to an individual or a team. As a
user, you can have accounts on one or many workspaces and can switch between these workspaces using the dropdown menu in
the top left-hand corner of the application. You also choose to have no workspace selected, which means you will see all
contents across all workspaces you have access to.

<Note>In [Personal](https://betterstacks.com/pricing) plan, you get one personal workspace and one companion
    workspace</Note>


## Creating a workspace

Find the `Workspace Switcher` in the top left-hand corner of the application. That button is your home for anything
related to workspaces. Click on it to open the workspace switcher and then click on the `Create Workspace` button.
A window will pop up asking you to enter the name of your workspace. Enter the name and click on the `Create` button.

When you create a workspace, you become the owner of that workspace. You can invite other users to join your workspace.
In fact, you can invite users to join your workspace right when you create it. Just enter the email addresses of the
users you want to invite and they will receive an email with an invitation link.

You can also create a workspace simply by pressing `⌘` `B` from anywhere in the app.


## Switching between workspaces

To switch between workspaces, click on the `Workspace Switcher` in the top left-hand corner of the application. You will
see a list of all workspaces you have access to. Click on the workspace you want to switch to and that workspace will
open in the app.

When you are in a particular workspace, you will only see saves, collections, and pages that belong to that workspace.
You can also clear the workspace selection by clicking on the `Clear` button in the workspace switcher. This will show
you all contents across all workspaces you have access to.

To switch to a workspace using a keyboard shortcut, press `⌘` `K` and then type search for `Switch workspace` and press
`Enter`. You will see a list of all workspaces you have access to. Use the arrow keys to navigate and press `Enter` to
select a workspace.

To clear the selected workspace, simply press `⌘` `Y` and the workspace selection will be cleared.
